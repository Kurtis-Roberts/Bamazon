# Bamazon

In this app you will need to open your command line/ terminal and install 3 node packages assuming you have node installed on your machine :
```
npm install mysql

npm install inquirer

npm install chalk
```

then also in your terminal you can run the code: ```node bamazonCustomer.js```

A list of products will be displayed and the terminal will then prompt you with a question about what item you would like to purchase based on the item id number.

The item id numbers are listed above and shows the product associated with the item id number, along with the department, price and quantity.

After you enter the item id number it will prompt you to answer how many you would like to buy of that product.

It will then confirm whether the item you bought is in stock and will congratulate you on your new purchase. It will also show your total price.

* If there is an insuffient amount of product it will ask you to review the product quantity and revise your order.

The item inventory will display on the terminal again and you will then be prompted with the questions of what product would you like to buy based on the item id number.
